**Data:** 

Data has been collected from pokemon.com, pokemondb and bulbapedia.
The data consists information about name of the pokemon, their types, 
their strength, speed, generation they belong to and if they are legendary or not.

**Assumptions:**

1. Each pokemon has a primary type named type 1 and secondary type named type 2 in the data.
Since the types of each pokemon is their strength and ability, I have combined Both so that each pokemon is identified by both their types.

2. For the pokemon to stay away from, I have assumed that the pokemon of types poison and ghost should be avoided becasue 
poison can kill us and the ghost types can scare us out of our life
